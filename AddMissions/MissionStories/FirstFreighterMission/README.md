# First Freigther Mission
A simple story, written in [Inky][https://github.com/inkle/inky]

The goal of this is to test whether we can connect a structured story to the lua script to generate No Man's Sky missions from it.

There are a bunch of variables defined that are meant to match NMS objects. Their names and structure will surely change in the future.
