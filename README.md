# NMS-Modding
Mod Projects for No Man`s Sky

Goal of this porject is to make cutom NMS mission creation as easy as possible.

Creating a interesting mod requires a great deal of software development skills and has a steep learning curve. Creating an interesting and engaging missions 
requires creative writing skills. These two skilla are not often found in one person.

We want to lower the difficulty of writing a good story and converting it to a NMS mission and create mechanisms / elements of technically complex NMS missions.

At this moment the project is at feasibility exploration stage. We want to try the combination of  useing Ink/Inkly to write a structured narrative, take the produced 
json or javastript output and through lua / [AMUMMS][https://www.nexusmods.com/nomanssky/mods/957] to automatically generate new missions and pack them into mods.
